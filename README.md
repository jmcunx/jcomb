## jcomb -- Combine Files

jcomb will combine files created by jsplit(1) and obsolete
utility j(1).

This was created for Systems that do not have
an easy method of concatenating Files.

To build, execute build.sh to generate a Makefile from
Makefile.template on most BSD/Linux systems and IBM AIX.
For MS-DOS, it should be rather easy to create a Makefile.

This requires [j\_lib2](https://github.com/jmcunx/j_lib2) to build.

[GNU automake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automake)
only confuses me, so I came up with my own method which
is a real hack.  But works for me.
