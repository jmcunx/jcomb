## jcomb -- Combine Files

**Note:** Starting October 12 2023, Microsoft GitHub is forcing
me to use my 2FA access to my repositories via my Cell Phone
or some proprietary application.  So updates to this project
will no longer occur on GitHub.  Updates can be downloaded
from my gemini capsule:

* gemini://gem.sdf.org/jmccue/computer/repository.gmi
* gemini://gem.sdf.org/jmccue/computer/repository.gmi (mirror)

[See gemini wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_(protocol)#Software) for clients.

jcomb will combine files created by
[jsplit(1)](https://github.com/jmcunx/jsplit)
and obsolete utility j(1).

This was created for Systems that do not have
an easy method of concatenating Files.

[j\_lib2](https://github.com/jmcunx/j_lib2) is an **optional** dependency.

[GNU automake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automake)
only confuses me, but this seems to be good enough for me.

**To compile:**
* If "DESTDIR" is not set, will install under /usr/local
* Execute ./build.sh to create a Makefile
* Works on Linux, BSD and AIX

_To uninstall_, execute
"make uninstall"
from the source directory
